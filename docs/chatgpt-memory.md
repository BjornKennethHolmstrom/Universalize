Björn Kenneth Holmström wants Universalize to include a spiritual and mystical perspective, finding commonalities in spirituality, religion, and mysticism, emphasizing the idea that 'all is one.'
	
Björn Kenneth Holmström wants Universalize to have a semi-linear progression similar to Final Fantasy VII, with a main structured path and increasingly free exploration over time. He envisions tailoring the experience to challenge visitors based on their faith and ideologies, starting with a Spiralize assessment and an alignment selection. The goal is to guide users toward universal understanding without implying that any perspective is wrong.
	
Björn Kenneth Holmström has reflected on the idea of universality and intuitively feels that nothing is truly universal in a certain sense—except perhaps God as the only truly universal 'thing,' but even beyond that.
	
Björn Kenneth Holmström wishes he had his mystical side more available to him. He used to write cryptic messages and poems related to mystical and philosophical themes.
	
Björn Kenneth Holmström wants mystical aphorisms, riddles, and cryptic insights to appear mystically in Universalize as little icons in random locations, not too often, but every now and then—similar to Chinese fortune cookies.
	
Björn Kenneth Holmström has started collecting mystical and playful messages for Universalize, including:

- **"Always near, never here nor there"**  
- **"A whisper from beyond"**  
- **"You caught a magical beast"**  
- **"Fun like bubble wrap"**  
- **"In between"**

Björn Kenneth Holmström has written two mystical poems for Universalize:

1. "More meta than the meta-metas  
   More theta than the alpha betas  
   More gamma than Buddhas dhamma  
   More concrete than a one-way street"

2. "The oddest thing alive  
   The unsolvable equation  
   The seamless automation  
   The inside that is outside  
   The only thing that ever was  
   Did you notice, that it’s you?"
