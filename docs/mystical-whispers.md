Always near, never here nor there

A whisper from beyond

You caught a magical beast

Fun like bubble wrap

In between 

More meta than the meta-metas
More theta than the alpha betas
More gamma than Buddhas dhamma
More concrete than a one-way street

The oddest thing alive
The unsolvable equation
The seamless automation
The inside that is outside
Then only thing that ever was
Did you notice, that itâ€™s you?
