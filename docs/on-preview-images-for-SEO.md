You don't need to create preview images right now - it's not bad to skip them initially. Here's why:

**What happens without preview images:**

The SEO component will fall back to your default logo (`/logo.svg`) which is already specified in the component. Social media platforms will show:
- Your Universalize logo
- The page title
- The description text

This is perfectly functional and looks professional.

**When preview images become valuable:**

1. **Higher engagement** - Custom previews get ~2-3x more clicks on social media
2. **Visual context** - Shows what the tool looks like before clicking
3. **Brand consistency** - Reinforces your cosmic/universal aesthetic

**My recommendation:**

**Phase 1 (now):** Launch without preview images. Focus on getting the tools working and content polished.

**Phase 2 (later):** Create preview images when:
- You have capacity for design work
- You notice people sharing the tools
- You want to increase social media conversion

**If you do create them later:**

Just make simple 1200x630px images with:
- Dark space background (matching your theme)
- Tool icon/emoji (üî¨, üìç, ‚è≥, etc.)
- Tool title in your brand font
- Maybe a subtle visual hint of what the tool does

You can even use screenshots of the actual tools with some light editing. Don't overcomplicate it.

**TL;DR:** Skip the preview images for now. Your logo will work fine as the fallback, and you can always add custom previews later when you have time.
